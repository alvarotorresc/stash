# @stash/api

Cloudflare Worker that serves the PWA and the `/api/*` routes on `stash.alvarotc.com`.

## Extraction proxy

`POST /api/extract` and `POST /api/extract/image` download a page or a preview image for the
client, which cannot do it itself because of CORS. The proxy downloads and forgets: nothing is
stored and the requested URL is never logged nor echoed. The contract lives in
`packages/core/src/extract.ts`.

### Images and pixel bombs

`POST /api/extract/image` accepts only JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF. Both the `Content-Type` of the
origin and the signature of the first bytes must match one of those types, and the body is capped
in bytes.

The server does not decode the image, so it does not limit its dimensions. A small, valid file can
declare a huge canvas (a pixel bomb). That protection belongs to the client: when it builds the
thumbnail, it must read or bound the dimensions before decoding (for example with
`createImageBitmap` and `resizeWidth`/`resizeHeight`) and discard images above a megapixel limit.

### User-Agent

Outbound requests identify themselves as
`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; StashPreview/0.1; +https://stash.alvarotc.com/bot)` and send only
`User-Agent` and `Accept`.

**Pending before release:** publish the page at `https://stash.alvarotc.com/bot`. It must explain
what StashPreview does (it only downloads a page when a user saves a link, stores nothing and
follows no links) and how to contact the maintainer.
